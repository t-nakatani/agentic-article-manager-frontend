# App Directory Design Document

## Purpose
The `app` directory contains the main application pages and routing structure, following Next.js 13's app directory convention.

## Key Files

### layout.tsx
- Defines the root layout for the entire application
- Wraps the application with necessary providers (e.g., AuthProvider)

### page.tsx
- The main page component for the application
- Renders the ArticleReader component

### login/page.tsx
- Handles user login functionality
- Provides both email/password and Google login options

## Design Principles
1. Server-Side Rendering: Utilize Next.js's SSR capabilities where appropriate
2. Clean Routing: Maintain a clear and intuitive routing structure
3. Separation of Concerns: Keep page components focused on layout and composition, delegating complex logic to components and hooks

## Future Considerations
- Implement dynamic routing for individual article pages
- Add error handling and 404 pages
- Consider implementing middleware for route protection and redirects
